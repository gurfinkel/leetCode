Given a list of words and two words  _word1_  and  _word2_, return the shortest distance between these two words in the list.

_word1_  and  _word2_  may be the same and they represent two individual words in the list.

**Example:**  
Assume that words =  `["practice", "makes", "perfect", "coding", "makes"]`.

**Input:** _word1_ = `“makes”`, _word2_ = `“coding”`
**Output:** 1

**Input:** _word1_ = `"makes"`, _word2_ = `"makes"`
**Output:** 3

**Note:**  
You may assume  _word1_  and  _word2_  are both in the list.
