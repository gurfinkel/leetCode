Given a string  `S`, consider all  _duplicated substrings_: (contiguous) substrings of S that occur 2 or more times. (The occurrences may overlap.)

Return  **any**  duplicated substring that has the longest possible length. (If  `S`  does not have a duplicated substring, the answer is  `""`.)

**Example 1:**

**Input:** "banana"
**Output:** "ana"

**Example 2:**

**Input:** "abcd"
**Output:** ""

**Note:**

1.  `2 <= S.length <= 10^5`
2.  `S`  consists of lowercase English letters.
