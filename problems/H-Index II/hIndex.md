Given an array of citations  **sorted in ascending order** (each citation is a non-negative integer) of a researcher, write a function to compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the [definition of h-index on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index): "A scientist has index _h_ if _h_ of his/her _N_ papers have **at least** _h_ citations each, and the other _N âˆ’ h_ papers have **no more than** _h_ citations each."

**Example:**

**Input:** `citations = [0,1,3,5,6]`
**Output:** 3 
**Explanation:** `[0,1,3,5,6]` means the researcher has `5` papers in total and each of them had 
             received 0`, 1, 3, 5, 6` citations respectively. 
             Since the researcher has `3` papers with **at least** `3` citations each and the remaining 
             two with **no more than** `3` citations each, her h-index is `3`.

**Note:**

If there are several possible values for _h_, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.

**Follow up:**

-   This is a follow up problem to [H-Index](https://leetcode.com/problems/h-index/description/), where  `citations`  is now guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.
-   Could you solve it in logarithmic time complexity?
